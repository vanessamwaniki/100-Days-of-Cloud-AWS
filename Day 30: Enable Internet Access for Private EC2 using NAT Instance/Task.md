The Nautilus DevOps team is tasked with enabling internet access for an EC2 instance running in a private subnet. This instance should be able to upload a test file to a public S3 bucket once it can access the internet. To minimize costs, the team has decided to use a NAT Instance instead of a NAT Gateway.

The following components already exist in the environment:
1) A VPC named xfusion-priv-vpc and a private subnet named xfusion-priv-subnet have been created.
2) An EC2 instance named xfusion-priv-ec2 is already running in the private subnet.
3) The EC2 instance is configured with a cron job that uploads a test file to the S3 bucket xfusion-nat-26225 every minute. Upload will only succeed once internet access is established.

Your task is to:

Create a new public subnet named xfusion-pub-subnet in the existing VPC.
Launch a NAT Instance in the public subnet using an Amazon Linux 2023 AMI and name it xfusion-nat-instance. Configure this instance to act as a NAT instance. Make sure to use a custom security group for this instance.
After the configuration, verify that the test file xfusion-test.txt appears in the S3 bucket xfusion-nat-26225. This indicates successful internet access from the private EC2 instance via the NAT Instance.

Note: iptables is not installed by default on Amazon Linux 2023. You will need to install and enable it before configuring NAT setup.
