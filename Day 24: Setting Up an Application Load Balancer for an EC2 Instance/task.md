Set up an Application Load Balancer named xfusion-alb.
Create a target group named xfusion-tg.
Create a security group named xfusion-sg to open port 80 for the public.
Attach this security group to the ALB.
The ALB should route traffic on port 80 to port 80 of the xfusion-ec2 instance.
Make appropriate changes in the default security group attached to the EC2 instance if necessary.
