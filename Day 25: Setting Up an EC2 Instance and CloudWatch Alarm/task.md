The Nautilus DevOps team has been tasked with setting up an EC2 instance for their application. 
To ensure the application performs optimally, they also need to create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the instance's CPU utilization. 
The alarm should trigger if the CPU utilization exceeds 90% for one consecutive 5-minute period. 
To send notifications, use the SNS topic named nautilus-sns-topic which is already created.

Launch EC2 Instance: Create an EC2 instance named nautilus-ec2 using any appropriate Ubuntu AMI.

Create CloudWatch Alarm: Create a CloudWatch alarm named nautilus-alarm with the following specifications:

Statistic: Average
Metric: CPU Utilization
Threshold: >= 90% for 1 consecutive 5-minute period.
Alarm Actions: Send a notification to nautilus-sns-topic.
